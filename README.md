# nice_note

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gilmoregrills/nice-note.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gilmoregrills/nice-note)

Terraform templates/config and any associated code is all stored in the `terraform/` directory,
actual source code that interacts with dialogflow/the remote components is all stored in `src/`.

This project has mostly been me messing around with using dialogflow to build something for a
while, and I lost a bunch of my original work on it when I changed laptops so atm it doesn't do
much of anything.
