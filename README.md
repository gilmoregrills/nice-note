A simple notes app!

The project uses Lerna to split work/deployments between the backend webhook stuff and the eventual electron frontend. It might be
overkill for such a small project, but I wanted to give it a try ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Currently, the code for the webhook that dialogflow calls is in modules/backend, and the electron app is in modules/frontend. This
will probably change as I add more components/realise all the horrible mistakes I've inevitably made.
